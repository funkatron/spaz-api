SpazAPI
=======

First of all, install FRAPI (Follow the instructions on : http://wiki.github.com/frapi/frapi/getting-started )

Then checkout the spaz-api and copy the folders included in the spaz-api checkout, into your FRAPI checkout (This is a work in progress as we are resolving the installation ticket, you may want to jump on irc.freenode.org #spaz or #frapi and talk to davidc_)
